# Quick Start - 4 Week Implementation

## Week 1: Foundation

- [ ] Study the 5-phase protocol until memorized
- [ ] Practice detection on daily interactions
- [ ] Begin documentation habits

**Daily Exercise:** Observe 3 interactions and identify any manipulation phases present.

---

## Week 2: Application

- [ ] Apply framework to past experiences
- [ ] Identify personal vulnerability patterns
- [ ] Develop phase-specific responses

**Daily Exercise:** Journal one past manipulation experience and map it to the 5 phases.

---

## Week 3: Mastery

- [ ] Predict manipulation sequences
- [ ] Test neutralization protocols
- [ ] Train others in pattern recognition

**Daily Exercise:** When you detect Phase 1-2, practice your exit strategy before Phase 3.

---

## Week 4: Integration

- [ ] Achieve 85%+ detection accuracy
- [ ] Maintain emotional equilibrium under pressure
- [ ] Become manipulation immune

**Milestone:** You can now recognize manipulation in real-time and exit before Phase 3.

## Success Metrics

| Week | Target |
|------|--------|
| 1 | 5-phase protocol memorized |
| 2 | 3+ past experiences mapped |
| 3 | Successful Phase 1-2 neutralization |
| 4 | 85%+ real-time detection |

---

## The Formula

```
M = (FE × CB × SR × CD × PE) × DC
```

Memorize this. It predicts manipulation with mathematical precision.

---

## Remember

**Phase 3 is your EXIT POINT.**

Once control demands begin (Phase 4), extraction becomes exponentially harder.
